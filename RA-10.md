### Chapter 10 - Error Handeling and Debugging

Execution Scope : **Global Context** and **Function Context**

There is one global execution contect and each function creates a new execution context.

**Hoisting** - all the variable and functions are *hoisted* to the top of the execution context.

Functions in JS have **lexical scope** - they are linked to the object they were defined *within*

There are seven types of built in error objects with JS:

**Error** - Generic Error
**SyntaxError** - Syntax has not been followed
**ReferenceError** - Tried to reference a variable that is not defined/in scope
**Type Error** - An unexpecteded data type that cannot be coerced
**Range Error** - Numbers not in acceptable range
**URI Error** - encodeURI(), decodeURI()< and similar methods used incorrectly
**EvalError** - eval () function used incorrectly

**Where** is the problem?

**What** is the problem?

It will be helpful to keep notes when debugging because it is easy to lose track of what has/has not been tested.

Console log is your friend!

console.info()
console.warn()
console.error()
console.group()
console.table() - where supported

Breakpoints will allow to step through the code bit by bit.
