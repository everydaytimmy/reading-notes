### Pain vs Suffering
Got it. This is goign to be tough.

1) What’s your perspective?
2) Why are you doing this?
3) Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
4) Are you doing this for you?

### The Big O

#### O(1)
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

``` 
bool IsFirstElementNull(IList<String> elements)
{
    return elements[0] == null;
} 
```

#### O(N)
O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 

```
bool ContainsValue(IEnumerable<string> elements, string value)
{
    foreach (var element in elements)
    {
        if (element == value) return true; 
    }     
    return false; 
}
```

#### O(N²)
O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

```
bool ContainsDuplicates(IList<string> elements)
{
    for (var outer = 0; outer < elements.Count; outer++) 
    {
        for (var inner = 0; inner < elements.Count; inner++) 
        { 
            // Don't compare with self 
            if (outer == inner) continue;             
            
            if (elements[outer] == elements[inner]) return true; 
        }
    }    
    return false;
}
```

#### O(2^N)
O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

```
int Fibonacci(int number)
{
    if (number <= 1) return number;
       
    return Fibonacci(number - 2) + Fibonacci(number - 1); 
}
```
