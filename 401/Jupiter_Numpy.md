Using NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations âˆ’

Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.

Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.

Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.

One of the limitations of NumPy is that all the elements in an array have to be of the same type, so if we include the header row, all the elements in the array will be read in as strings. Because we want to be able to do computations like find the average quality of the wines, we need the elements to all be floats.

## JupyterLab 

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. For a demonstration of JupyterLab and its features, you can view this video:
