### TDD

Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think (and write!) **tests first**.

A convention widely used is the **AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert**.
**Arrange**: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
**Act**: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
**Assert**: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

- Write a unit test and make it fail
- Write the feature and make the test pass!
- Refactor the code

### Recursion

####What is Recursion? 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

**base case** - In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. 

If the base case is not reached or not defined, then the stack overflow problem may arise.

A recursive function is **tail recursive** when recursive call is the last thing executed by the function
