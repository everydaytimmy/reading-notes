This was an interesting article on so many levels. While the circumstances that the author found himself in are not unqiue it was commendable that he felt guily and resigned afterwards. It's also probably more common that in the moment there is little thought if what you're doign is 'wrong' or immoral and it's only after the fact that there is reflection and regret. I also wonder what all of the other people thought as well, after all there was an entire group of people from the software company to the pharmacutical company that was complicit in all of this.

In the end my main takeaway was how the person did not even think about what they were doing until after the fact which is probalbly the way it is for almost everybody.
