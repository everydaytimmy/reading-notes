#### Django Settings: Best practices
- Keep settings in environment variables.
- Write default values for production configuration (excluding secret keys and tokens).
- Don’t hardcode sensitive settings, and don’t put them in VCS.
- Split settings into groups: Django, third-party, project.
- Follow naming conventions for custom (project) settings.


SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet. The service was created as a secure replacement for the unencrypted Telnet and uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that all communication to and from the remote server happens in an encrypted manner. It provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client.
