## From the Duckett HTML book:

#### Chapter 4: “Links” (pp.62-73)

<a href= ...> </a> tag to set up links.
Use relative URL for internal links 
For linking on the same page use Ids and #'Id' in the <a>
  
#### Chapter 15: “Layout” 
BIG chapter. This is what lets the pages have moe of a visual pop and arrange lots of information on a page.

Block Level Elements - start on a new line
Inline Elements - flow in between surrounding text

All about the `<div>`s. Need to start adding to the index.html
Outside of normal flow use Z-index to keep the right things on top.
  
Fixed position seems to do the same basically as Z-index...

Floating elements good for block quotes.

Am going to spend some more time inspecting elements of websites that I like to get a sense of how they tackle the CSS styling.

## From the Duckett JS book:

#### Functions
Function are just like recipies. You assign them a name and tell them what they should do. 

``function add(number) {
  return number + number;
}``

#### Pair Programming

Already familair with pair programming and it's benefits. Good practice. Was used extensivly at companies I have worked at in the past and be dev friends.
