### Javascript Call Stack

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

The key takeaways from the call stack are:
1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.


### Types of error messages

#### Reference errors
This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type of errors.

#### Syntax errors
I know it’s in the name of the errors, but like it says itself, this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

#### Range errors
Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

#### Type errors
Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
