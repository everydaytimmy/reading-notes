# Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)
Images that you use on a webstie should be saved at the same width and height you want them to appear on the page.
Gifs are awesome - everyone knows that .

## Three rules for creating images:

### Save images in the right format.
### Save images at the right size.
### Measue inamges in pixels.

Picture alignment is a big deal but addressed now with CSS (Chapter 12)

# Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)

The color chapter seemed very technical. 

While there are many ways to detrming color (RGB values, Hex Codes, Color Names) I get the sense that for most cases I will use the handy-dandy tools in VSC and a number of 'go-to's when it comes to color selection.

Besides Hue ther eis also Saturation, Brightness, Contrast, and Opacity that will effect how things look on the screen.

# Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)

To be honest this chapter seemed basic due to the fact many of these components are already built into word provessing programs like Word, Pages, and GoogleDocs.
It is worth pointing out though that different browsers support different fonts.
www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator is tool that can convert fonts for you. 

Line leading is like Box Margins and I am curious how often I will use the ability to adjust word spacing. 

First letter and First line look interesting though and maybe a fun way to add some spice. 

The biggest thing for me in this chaper is the ``text-align``. Will certainly use this a lot for both pure text and moving images around groups of text. With images though I wonder how much is done with the text align or if the images and the text would be in sperate boxes and then moved around that way.
