### React Forms

#### Controlled Components

In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. 
  
In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`.

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. 

In React, a `<textarea>` uses a `value` attribute instead.

#### Handling Multiple Inputs
When you need to handle multiple controlled `input` elements, you can add a `name` attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of `event.target.name`.
