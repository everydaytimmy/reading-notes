## Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)

In an object variables becomne known as properties and object become known as methods.

#### Values are linked by Keys

Basically anything can be an object.


## Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)
(certainly the most convoluted chapter so far)

The DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browswer window.

The DOM tree consists of the following:
#### The Document Node
#### The Element Node
#### The Attribute Node
#### Text Node

Step 1: Access the Elenments
Step 2: Work with those elements

There are many ways to call an element.
These include ID, Tag name, class name, or all.

They deomnstrate often the need to have an if statement to make sure there are items in the nodelist. 

The bit on XSS seemed intersting but i wasn't picking up on too much of it. I will look at other sources for a clearer picture. 

The ability to inspect the DOM in a browser will be very helpful.
