#### Working in Teams:

"Project Aristotle"

In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. 
Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

"After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams."

"The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another."

As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’

"Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues."

#### psychological safety

"What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home."



### CSS Transforms

```div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}
```

Can performs Skew, Scale, Perspective, and Rotate.
There is also a way to cube the property.

For a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. 

There are four transition related properties in total:
```transition-property```, ```transition-duration```, ```transition-timing-function```, and ```transition-delay```. \

Long story short - you can do a lot with ```hover```.
