### THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS

What we really want is

* a lot of storage space
* on the client
* that persists beyond a page refresh
* and isn’t transmitted to the server

HTML5 Storage is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser.

You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. 

The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. 

If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like ```parseInt()``` or ```parseFloat()``` to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.

Certain browser vendors also refer to HTML5 storage as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage.”

From your JavaScript code, you’ll access HTML5 Storage through the localStorage object on the global window object.
