## State and Lifecycle

State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

### Converting a Function to a Class

You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:

1. Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
2. Add a single empty method to it called render().
3. Move the body of the function into the render() method.
4. Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

#### Lifecycle Methods
Mounting and Unmounting - This will free up resources when the DOM is finished using something.

### Using State Correctly
There are three things you should know about `setState(`).

1. Do Not Modify State Directly
2. State Updates May Be Asynchronous
3. State Updates are Merged

## Handling Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements.

When using React, you generally donâ€™t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

## Conditional Rendering

In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.
