## From the Duckett HTML book:

### Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)

Simple chapter on lists. Nothing too complicated. Memorization. I have not had exposure to definition lists. Added to my toolbox

###Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)

A lot of good information in this chapter. Color and text size are good to know but managing the elemnt boxes are where it's at from a visualization perspective. 
There are so many different options and I am guessing that it will fit Pareto as far as frequency of use. Many of the stylings I do not see very often on modern webpages.

I found this article that is helpful for thinking about box sizing. https://css-tricks.com/exploring-the-complexities-of-width-and-height-in-css/

css-tricks will no doubt be an often used resource for me throughout the course.

*Still waiting on this book in the mail though I do have some expoosure to decisions and loops.
I prefer switch statements for longer conditionals. Loops include 'for' 'while' and 'do while'

For execute a number of times, while executes while true, do - while executes until false. 

Examples from W3:
 var i;
for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
 
 while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}

let result = '';
let i = 0;

do {
  i = i + 1;
  result = result + i;
} while (i < 5);
