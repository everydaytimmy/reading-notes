“Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify." — John Outerhout

### What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

#### Pure Functions:
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as `deterministic`)
It does not cause any observable side effects

#### Reading Files
If our function reads external files, it’s not a pure function — the file’s contents can change.

#### Random number generation
Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.

**Observation:** mutability is discouraged in functional programming.
