## From the Duckett HTML book:

### Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)

This was a pretty basic chapter that highlights the various html tags for text. Would be helpful to have them all written down on a quick reference sheet

### Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)

Again - basic chapter on CSS basics. Syntax is: Selector {Delaration} and property:value. More nuance at play vs HTML. 

Be mindful of cascade rules and inheritance.

## From the Duckett JS book:

*Still waiting on this book in the mail*

### Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)

### Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
